Note for reviewer
------------

Unfortunately I ran out out time and I still have the following things on my list:

 - Adding the scores from previous competition days together so that the scoring tables are cumulative.
 - I could definitely do with a few more comments, but I also tend to try and write code that can be easily understood without them.
 - Graceful error handling.
 - Justifying the table output.
 - I would also go over it again and look for oppurtunities to refactor. I'm sure there's plenty.
